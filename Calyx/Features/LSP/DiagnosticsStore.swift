//
//  DiagnosticsStore.swift
//  Calyx
//
//  Actor that holds per-workspace, per-URI diagnostic snapshots produced by
//  LSP `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` notifications, with point-in-time
//  snapshot IDs so MCP clients can pull only the deltas since their last
//  poll.
//
//  Spec reference (publishDiagnostics):
//  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.18/specification/#textDocument_publishDiagnostics
//
//  Per-URI versioning:
//    - LSP servers send the absolute set of diagnostics for a URI on each
//      notification. An empty `diagnostics` array means "clear".
//    - When `version` is present, an incoming publish is accepted iff it is
//      strictly newer than the version we already have for that URI. A nil
//      incoming version overwrites unconditionally (the server is telling
//      us "this is current, I'm not versioning"). A nil stored version is
//      always overwritten by anything new.
//
//  Snapshots and diff:
//    - Internally we track a workspace-local monotonic `changeCounter`
//      that bumps on every accepted ingest. Each URI remembers the counter
//      value at its last change (`lastChangedAt`).
//    - `createSnapshot` issues a strictly-monotonic `SnapshotId` and records
//      the current `changeCounter` against it. `diff(since:)` returns the
//      URIs whose `lastChangedAt` is greater than the counter value at the
//      snapshot — that is, all URIs that changed *after* the snapshot was
//      taken. A cleared URI is materialised as an empty diagnostic array
//      in the diff (the store stores the empty array verbatim).
//
